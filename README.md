# edlib-rs

This crate provides a Rust interface to the Edlib C++ library by Martin Šošić. [Martinsos edlib](https://github.com/Martinsos/edlib)

The reference paper is :

Martin Šošić, Mile Šikić; Edlib: a C/C ++ library for fast, exact sequence alignment using edit distance. Bioinformatics 2017 [btw753. doi] <https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btw753>

The crate offers 2 interfaces to edlib.  
The first accessed via module bindings is direcly the interface generated by the bindgen crate.  
The second via module edlibrs provides a more idiomatic Rust interface. It comes at the cost of cloning information stored in pointers startLocations and endLocations in **EdlibAlignResult** to get a Rust **struct EdlibAlignResultRs** with **Option<Vec\<u8\>>** fields instead of pointers and in cigar string representation.  
As a consequence memory management is fully transferred to Rust.  
Structures and functions have the same name as in edlib with just "Rs" appended to original names.

## Installation

The crate relies on the C++ edlib library being installed and compiled as described in edlib documentation.  
Before running cargo build (or cargo install) the environment variable EDLIB_DIR must be set to where the original C++ edlib directory was cloned. This is necessary for the build.rs step of Cargo to access the edlib library includes.
Also libstdc++ must be in your path.
