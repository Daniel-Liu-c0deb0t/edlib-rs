# edlib-rs

This crate provides a Rust interface to the Edlib C++ library by Martin Šošić. [Martinsos edlib](https://github.com/Martinsos/edlib)

The algorithm implemented is the computation of the edit (or Levenshtein) distance as described in the paper:

Martin Šošić, Mile Šikić; Edlib: a C/C ++ library for fast, exact sequence alignment using edit distance. Bioinformatics 2017 [btw753. doi] <https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btw753>

The interface mostly relies on the bindgen crate (see module bindings). The raw bindings generated by bindgen
can be accessed via the the module bindings. The module edlibrs provides a more idiomatic Rust interface. It comes at the cost of cloning information stored in pointers startLocations and endLocations in **EdlibAlignResult** to get a Rust **struct EdlibAlignResultRs** with **Option<Vec\<u8\>>** fields. As a consequence the way memory management is down by Rust.

## Installation

The crate relies on the C++ edlib library being installed and compiled as described in edlib documentation.  
Before running cargo build (or cargo install) the environment variable EDLIB_DIR must be set to where the original C++ edlib directory was cloned for the build.rs step of Cargo to access the necessary includes.
